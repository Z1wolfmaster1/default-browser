# Default Browser

I really like the Edge browser, and I recently installed the Dev version to use while I'm coding.However it annoyed me that every link I opened went to the normal version. So I created this script to help me switch the default browser faster.

## SetUserFTA

For the script to work, you must have [SetUserFTA.exe](https://kolbi.cz/blog/2017/10/25/setuserfta-userchoice-hash-defeated-set-file-type-associations-per-user/) in the same folder as the script. This executable is not my authorship.

## Arguments

The script accepts the following arguments:

### `on`

Set Edge Dev as default browser.

### `off`

Set Edge as default browser.

### `install`

Add the folder the script is in to the system `path` environment variable.

### `uninstall`

Remove the folder the script is in from the system `path` environment variable.
